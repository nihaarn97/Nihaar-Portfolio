A peek at my journey in the field of Data Science

# [Eduvance](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks)
I worked on the following projects as part of my internship and industrial training at Eduvance
* **[Diamond Data Analysis](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Diamond_Data_Analysis.ipynb) -**

   Used the funtionalities of Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a large dataset of different diamond types to understand relation between different features and gain other insights.  
* **[Regression Analysis on Autombile Dataset](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Regression_Automobile_MPG.ipynb) -**

   Performing Linear Regression to predict the miles per gallon for a car model based on relevant features.  
* **[Perceptron Model for Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Perceptron_Diabetes_Predict.ipynb) -**

   Predicting whether a person has diabetes using relevant features.  
* **[Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Modelling.ipynb) -**

   Predicting whether a person has diabetes using relevant features.  
* **[Iris Classification](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Iris_Classification_Tree.ipynb) -**

   Predicting whether a person has diabetes using relevant features.  
* **[Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Clustering_Analysis_KMeans.ipynb) -**

   Performed K-Means Clustering on a given dataset with 2 columns. Visualized the clusters to understand basic cluster properties.
* **[Volcanic Eruption Clustering](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Volcanic_Eruption_Cluster.ipynb) -**

   Built a K-Means Clustering Model using features Eruption Duration and Time Between Eruptions on a dateset of volcanic eruption activity.
