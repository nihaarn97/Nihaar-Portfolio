# Nihaar_Portfolio
My journey in the field of Data Science

# [<ins>Eduvance Internship</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks)
Following are some of the projects that I worked on as part of the Summer Internship and Industrial Training Program at Eduvance
* **[<ins>Diamond Data Analysis](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Diamond_Data_Analysis.ipynb) -**

   Used the functionalities of Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a large dataset of different diamond types to understand relation between different features and gain other insights.  
* **[<ins>Iris Classification</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Iris_Classification_Tree.ipynb) -**

   Built and compared the performance of Decision Tree Models of varying depths to predict class of Iris Flower based on relevant features that were picked on the basis of correlation.  
* **[<ins>Perceptron Model for Diabetes Prediction</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Perceptron_Diabetes_Predict.ipynb) -**

   Built a perceptron model to predict whether a person has Diabetes or not based on their Age and Glucose levels. Performed EDA on the dataset to gain other insights.
* **[<ins>Regression Analysis on Autombile Dataset</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Regression_Automobile_MPG.ipynb) -**

   Analyzed given dataset to pick suitable features and build a Linear Regression Model that can predict the miles per gallon for car models from different years.    
* **[<ins>Titanic Survival Prediction</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Modelling.ipynb) -**

   Built a Perceptron Model and Decision Tree Model using a dataset of passengers on Titanic and whether they survived or not. Both models could predict survival of passengers to a high degree.   
* **[<ins>Clustering Analysis</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Clustering_Analysis_KMeans.ipynb) -**

   Performed K-Means Clustering on a given dataset with 2 columns. Visualized the clusters to understand basic cluster properties.
* **[<ins>Volcanic Eruption Clustering</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Volcanic_Eruption_Cluster.ipynb) -**

   Built a K-Means Clustering Model from a dateset of volcanic eruption activity using features Eruption Duration and Time Between Eruptions. Predicted clusters for new data points.
