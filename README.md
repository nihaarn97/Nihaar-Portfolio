# [<ins>Eduvance Internship</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks)
### Projects that I worked on as part of the Summer Internship and Industrial Training Program at Eduvance
* **[<ins>Diamond Data Analysis</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Diamond_Data_Analysis.ipynb) -**

   Used the functionalities of Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a large dataset of different diamond types to understand relation between different features and gain other insights.  
* **[<ins>Iris Classification</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Iris_Classification_Tree.ipynb) -**

   Built and compared the performance of Decision Tree Models of varying depths to predict class of Iris Flower based on relevant features that were picked on the basis of correlation.  
* **[<ins>Perceptron Model for Diabetes Prediction</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Perceptron_Diabetes_Predict.ipynb) -**

   Built a perceptron model to predict whether a person has Diabetes or not based on their Age and Glucose levels. Performed EDA on the dataset to gain other insights.
* **[<ins>Regression Analysis on Autombile Dataset</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Regression_Automobile_MPG.ipynb) -**

   Analyzed given dataset to pick suitable features and build a Linear Regression Model that can predict the miles per gallon for car models from different years.    
* **[<ins>Titanic Survival Prediction</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Modelling.ipynb) -**

   Built a Perceptron Model and Decision Tree Model using a dataset of passengers on Titanic and whether they survived or not. Both models could predict survival of passengers to a high degree.   
* **[<ins>Clustering Analysis</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Clustering_Analysis_KMeans.ipynb) -**

   Performed K-Means Clustering on a given dataset with 2 columns. Visualized the clusters to understand basic cluster properties.
* **[<ins>Volcanic Eruption Clustering</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/Eduvance_Notebooks/blob/main/Volcanic_Eruption_Cluster.ipynb) -**

   Built a K-Means Clustering Model from a dateset of volcanic eruption activity using features Eruption Duration and Time Between Eruptions. Predicted clusters for new data points.

# [<ins>IBM Data Science</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science)
### Projects that I worked on during the IBM Data Science Professional Certification offered on Coursera
* **[<ins>Stock Price Visualization</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%206%20-%20Webscraping%20%26%20SQL%20Magic/Stocks_Viz_API_Scraping.ipynb) -**

   Used the yfinance library and webscraping to visualize the growth of Tesla Stock over the years and the Crowd-Sourced short squeeze of GameStop Stock.  
* **[<ins>Analysis With SQL Magic</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%206%20-%20Webscraping%20%26%20SQL%20Magic/SQL_Magic_Analysis.ipynb) -**

   Performed analysis on datasets from the city of Chicago to gain insights using the SQL Magic functionality of Jupyter kernel. The datasets were dumped in the Db-2 database of IBM Cloud.  
* **[<ins>Basics of Data Wrangling</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%207%20-%20Data%20Analysis/Automobile_Data_Wrangling.ipynb) -**
