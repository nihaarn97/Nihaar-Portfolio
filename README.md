# [<ins>IBM Data Science</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science)
### Projects that I worked on during the IBM Data Science Professional Certification offered on Coursera
* **[<ins>Stock Price Visualization</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%206%20-%20Webscraping%20%26%20SQL%20Magic/Stocks_Viz_API_Scraping.ipynb) -**

   Used the yfinance library and webscraping to gather stock data and visualize the growth of Tesla Stock over the years and the Crowd-Sourced short squeeze of GameStop Stock.  
* **[<ins>Data analysis With SQL Magic</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%206%20-%20Webscraping%20%26%20SQL%20Magic/SQL_Magic_Analysis.ipynb) -**

   Performed analysis on datasets from the city of Chicago to gain insights using the SQL Magic functionality of Jupyter Kernel. The datasets were dumped in the Db-2 database of IBM Cloud.  
* **[<ins>Data Wrangling</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%207%20-%20Data%20Analysis/Automobile_Data_Wrangling.ipynb) -**

   Applied concepts of Data Wrangling like Handling Missing Values, Feature Engineering, Normalization, Binning and Encoding on an automobile dataset to prepare it for further analysis.    
* **[<ins>Exploratory Data Analysis</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%207%20-%20Data%20Analysis/Automobile_EDA.ipynb) -**

   Applied concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis like Feature Pattern Visualization, Desciptive Statistical Analysis, P-Value Correlation and ANOVA on an automobile dataset to identify important features for modelling.   
* **[<ins>Model Evaluation and Refinement</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%207%20-%20Data%20Analysis/Automobile_Model_Eval.ipynb) -**

   Applied concepts of Model Evaluation like Overfitting, Underfitting and Cross-Validation on an autombile dataset. Also performed Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search to increase accuracy of selected model.   
 * **[<ins>Housing Price Predictor</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%207%20-%20Data%20Analysis/Housing_Wrangling_EDA_Eval.ipynb) -**

   Performed Wrangling and EDA on a dataset of house sales in King County, USA. Built a Linear Regression Model, Polynomial Regression Pipeline and a Ridge Regression Model to predict the price of a house based on important features.   
 * **[<ins>Movie Recommender System</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%209%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Movies_UserCF_RecSys.ipynb) -**

   Developed a system for recommending movies using scores calculatted from [<ins>User Based</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%209%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Movies_UserCF_RecSys.ipynb) Collaborative Filtering.

   Built classifier models - KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression & Decision Tree - to predict whether a customer will pay or default on their loan using a dateset of past loan application statuses. Models were evaluated on the basis of Jaccard & F-1 Score to pick the best model.
* **[<ins>Temperature Anomaly Detection</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Course%209%20-%20Machine%20Learning/Weather_Station_Cluster.ipynb) -**

   Used DBSCAN to cluster Canadian weather stations based on location and temperature data for a given month. Utilized the obtained clusters to identify anomalies in weather conditions by analyzing outliers in clusters.
* **[<ins>SpaceX Boosters Landing Outcome Prediction</ins>](https://github.com/nihaarn97/IBM_Data_Science/blob/main/Capstone/SpaceX_Machine_Learning.ipynb) -**

   As a Data Scientist for a competiting startup, I developed and evaluated models for predicting when the SpaceX Falcon missions will be unable to land their first stage boosters thus, leading to an increase in cost of launch. This information could then be used by us to bid for the launch at a lower price. Data was collected using SpaceX API and scraping SpaceX Falcon wiki.
